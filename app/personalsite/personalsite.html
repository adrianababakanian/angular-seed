    <h4 class="section-subtitle"> I built the previous iteraion of personal site
      up from sratch when I was just becoming familiar with web development. Although
      it was very rewarding to start with blank HTML, stylesheets, and scripts and then
      StackOverflow my way through every obstacle I encountered, my from-the-ground-up
      approach resulted in laggy page loads and suboptimal programming style. So, I
      decided to teach myself AngularJS in order to build a faster and cleaner site. It is
      still a work in progress, and I am excited to continue working on it!

      Things to look forward to: command-line inspired user interface, more hidden animations,
      and enhanced responsiveness.
