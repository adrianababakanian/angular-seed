            <span style="font-size: 20px;">Nice to meet you! <br>I'm <b>Adriana Babakanian</b>, a third-year
            Regents' Scholar at the <em>University of California, Berkeley</em>
            pursuing a double major in <em>Applied Mathematics</em> and <em>Computer
            Science</em>.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            I have a keen passion for creating, especially when it comes to
            human-centered products that lie at the intersection of design &
            technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            You're likely to catch me with my nose in a book &#x1F4D6;,
            sipping matcha &#x1F375;, hacking something up &#x1F4BB;,
            doodling &#x1F3A8;, exploring SF &#x1F309;,
            or in pursuit of tempura &#x1F364;.

            <!-- I've always been fascinated by the cognitive
            intersection between the technical laws that construct
            our everyday lives and the visual ways in which we perceive
            them. This has lead me to explore and combine realms of
            programming, mathematics, cognitive neuroscience, design,
            and art. -->
