        Nice to meet you! I'm Adriana Babakanian, a third-year
        Regents' Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley
        pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and Computer
        Science.

        <!-- I've always been fascinated by the cognitive
        intersection between the technical laws that construct
        our everyday lives and the visual ways in which we perceive
        them. This has lead me to explore and combine realms of
        programming, mathematics, cognitive neuroscience, design,
        and art. -->
